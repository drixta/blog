I knew that if I created a blog I would go with Jekyll, the static site generator powering <a href="http://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>, written in Ruby. Octopress takes care of a lot of the legwork and made this process much easier.

Thanks to <a href="http://octopress.org/" target="_blank">Octopress</a>, and <a href="http://alexgaribay.com/" target="_blank">Alex Garibay</a> for the theme!
