I'm Drew Sheneman. I live in Northeast Ohio with my wife, and very soon a small human who will look quite similar to both of us. We feel very excited and blessed ... and thankfully <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/" target="_blank">thinkgeek</a> has provided a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/b5e5/?srp=4" target="_blank">technical manual</a> for these types of situations. I am sure this will not cover every scenario, please feel free to send me advice and friendly tips (or horror stories) at <a href="mailto:drewsheneman@gmail.com">drewsheneman@gmail.com</a>.

## Real Quick ##

I am interested in the idea of aquiring wisdom and not solely knowlege. I am passionate about travel, and have made several ~~valiant~~ failed attempts at learning new languages. I enjoy learning new coding languages and frameworks.
<br/>
## Background ##

I have a BA in Computer Science and have done professional development in Java, C#, as well as PHP. I am currently learning Ruby.
